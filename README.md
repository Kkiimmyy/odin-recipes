# odin-recipes

This project is to test and demonstrate my HTML skills that I have 
learned from The Odin Project. At this stage, I have learned the 
basics such as how to create a basic webpage, how each element works and getting used to the git workflow. At the end of this project, I should be able to build a basic recipe webpage.
