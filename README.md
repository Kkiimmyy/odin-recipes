# odin-recipes

This project is to test and demonstrate my HTML skills that I have 
learned from The Odin Project. At this stage, I have learned the 
basics such as how to create a basic webpage, how each element works and getting used to the git workflow. At the end of this project, I should be able to build a basic recipe webpage.

Afterthoughts:
Making this simple website really made me get used to the git workflow. At first I wasn't sure when to push changes, but over time I got the gist of it. While not perfect, I feel more confident with the git workflow. I've also gotten used to the tags and elements for html in the making of this website.
